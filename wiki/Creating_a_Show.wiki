#summary Creating a Vusion Show XML file
#labels Documentation

You should read [http://code.google.com/p/vusion/w/edit/Vusion_Show_XML_Document_Specification this document] as it contains the specification.

At the moment there are no specific tools to create show files but you can use _vusion-midi-grab_ to find out values to put in the midi section of the document.
